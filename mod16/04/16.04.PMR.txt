 + I enjoyed this section of writing the program as it really highlights the difference between Arrays and Lists/ArrayLists.
 = I had been confused about differences between the data formats and why one would perfer to use Arrays.
 = This exercise showed me how Arrays function differently than ArrayLists especially in regards to shifting objects within an array.
